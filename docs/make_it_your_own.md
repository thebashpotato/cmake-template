# Everything you need to change

> These two steps should be done before configuring or building the project

1. In your editor do a global search and replace for `myproject_` and replace it with `name_of_your_project_`.
2. Rename the `core/include/myproject_core` folder to `core/include/name_of_your_project_core`

That's it you are good to go.
